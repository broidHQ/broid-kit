## Code of Conduct

Make sure that you're read and understand the [Code of Conduct](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/2/0/).

## CLA

To protect the interests of the Broid contributors, Broid, customers and end users we require contributors to sign a [Contributors License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/broidhq/integrations) (CLA) before we pull the changes into the main repository. [Our CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/broidhq/integrations) is simple and straightforward - it requires that the contributions you make to any Broid open source project are properly licensed and that you have the legal authority to make those changes. This helps us significantly reduce future legal risk for everyone involved. It's easy---no faxing or printing required!

You can digitally sign the [CLA online](https://cla-assistant.io/broidhq/integrations). Please indicate your email address in your first pull request so that we can make sure that will locate your CLA. Once you've submitted it, you no longer need to send one for subsequent submissions.

# Conventions

## The reasons for these conventions:
- automatic generating of the changelog
- simple navigation through git history (e.g. ignoring style changes)

## Format of the commit message:
```bash
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Example commit message:

```bash
fix(slack): fix webhook endpoint

Updates the Slack webhook to match the updated API.

Fixes #4433
```

## Message subject (first line)
The first line cannot be longer than 70 characters, the second line is always blank and
other lines should be wrapped at 80 characters. The type and scope should
always be lowercase as shown below.

### Allowed `<type>` values:

* **feat** (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
* **fix** (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
* **docs** (changes to the documentation)
* **style** (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
* **refactor** (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
* **test** (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
* **chore** (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

### Example `<scope>` values:

* discord
* schemas
* slack

The `<scope>` can be empty (e.g. if the change is a global or difficult
to assign to a single component), in which case the parentheses are
omitted. In smaller projects such as Karma plugins, the `<scope>` is empty.


## Message body
* uses the imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”
* includes motivation for the change and contrasts with previous behavior

```bash
Closes #234
```
or in the case of multiple issues:
```bash
Closes #123, #245, #992
```

### Breaking changes

All breaking changes have to be mentioned in footer with the
description of the change, justification and migration notes.
```bash
BREAKING CHANGE:

`broid-slack` no longer supports method `getRouter` and will return null. Make sure to handle it appropriately.
```
